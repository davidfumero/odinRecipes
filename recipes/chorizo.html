        <h2 class="subheader">Description</h2>
        <p>Chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a pepper, onion, and potato mixture.  There is only a bit of chorizo in this dish but it provides so much flavor that any more may be too rich.</p>

        <h3 class="subheader">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>113.5g Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>25g onion</li>
            <li>75g bell peppers</li>
            <li>49.5g chorizo</li>
            <li>3.75g olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subheader">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F</li>
            <li>Wash and cut your potatoes into a medium dice.</li>
            <li>Add to a sheet pan with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes and then flip. Cook an additional 8-10 minutes or until you achieve proper browning.</li>
            <li>Wash and chop your onion and peppers into a medium dice. Sauté in olive oil until softened. Stir in the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Cook the chorizo and scrambled eggs, together is fine, separate if you'd prefer the separation. Be careful not to overcook your eggs as you will be reheating them again in the microwave if you are meal prepping this dish.</li>
        </ol>
