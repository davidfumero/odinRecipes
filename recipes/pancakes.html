        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Protein pancakes made from oat flour and a blend of whey and casein protein for a high protein breakfast option. You can prep the dry ingredients in advanced and have these ready to go quickly each morning.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6.25g vanilla whey/casein blend 50/50 blend. I mix 12.5g of whey and 12.5g of casein together</li>
            <li>5g oat flour</li>
            <li>2.5g tapioca flour or cornstarch</li>
            <li>0.25g baking powder</li>
            <li>15g liquid egg whites</li>
            <li>18.75g plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>6.25g water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together so no clumps are present. NOTE: I have tested this with only whey protein and it doesn't turn out as well. Only casein will work but you may need more water in the batter. The 50/50 blend is best.</li>
            <li>Add in the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle/skillet on medium heat and spray with oil. Add the batter and cook for a couple minutes, then flip.</li>
        </ol>
